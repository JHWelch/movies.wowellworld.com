        Don‚Äôt you miss movie nights?
      </h2>

      <p>
        Well, we did, and that‚Äôs why we decided to start hosting them! Back when we were kids, going to a movie night at a friends‚Äô was the best way to spend an evening. Microwave popcorn, soda, energy drinks, frozen pizzas, too many people piled onto a couch, and the sounds of a DVD from the local rental store playing in the background all meant you were in store for an evening full of laughter, screams, witty comments, and lifetime memories.
      </p>

      <p>
        Even though we‚Äôre a bit older now and some of the snacks have changed (we might actually make the pizza instead of just grabbing a frozen one), the fun of a movie night with your pals will never get old. So join us on most Thursday evenings at the Wowell abode in Wrigleyville for a themed movie night! We will usually either have some snacks/food or order food together, but feel free to bring a dish to pass or a beverage, grab a seat, and settle in for - Movie Night!
