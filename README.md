### Repository Structure

This repository is split into two applications

- `src/server` - The Node.js Express server that serves the application and handles API requests.
- `src/client` - The Vue application served by the Express server that handles the UI.

## Deploy to App Engine

This app is deployed to Google App Engine. It will automatically deploy on all merges to `main`. This is the preferred method of deployment.

App engine will build the application with `npm run build` and serve the application with `npm run start`.

Manual deployments can be performed with the built in script.

You must first have a copy of `.env.production` in the root directory. Then run:

```sh
sh scripts/deploy.sh
```
